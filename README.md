## To Run locally

Assuming Node and NPM are already installed, after cloning the repository in a directory, execute the following commands to install the node_modules and run a local Nextjs server.

```bash
> npm install
> npm run dev
# or its yarn/pnp/... equivalent
```


## Live Demo

## Decisions

This site currently uses Nextjs AppRouter but there will probably be a branch with the the new React Router 7+.
