You must work to free your mind. You have to do that, begin the process of freeing your mind by  evaluating everything that you&apos;ve been taught. Everything. And develop a discriminating eye so that you can ultimately learn what not to  believe. You don&apos;t want to believe what everyone tells you. You want to get some information to reinforce that, to validate. that information to determine  whether or not it should be programmed within your consciousness';

 const browderSnippet0Quote ='All of these things are done in order to manipulate the images which will ultimates affect and influence your consciousness. Now we need to realize that racism is an unavoidable fact of life in America. We need to understand how racist images attack us  constantly 24 hours a day. We need to understand that whoever is responsible for craeting images will ultimately determine  your level of consciousness.  How you feel about yourself[personal note: like feeling dependent on the government or feeling unable to     make change] is determined by how you see yourself. And if the images that are constantly projected around you say that you are less  than human,  then you will act less than human. Others will regard you as less than human.  Carter G Woodson said it best, when he said  &quot;when you control a Man*apos;s thinking you don&apos;t have to worry about his actions, you don&apos;t have to  tell him to stand here or there for he will find his proper place and will stay in it.  A person who has been miseducated does not have to be ordered to the back door in any society for they will go  without being told.  In fact, if there is no back door, there very nature is to demand one.  Why? Because their miseducation makes it necessary[like falling under someon&apos;s spell].&quot;';

    <li>Chapter 3 of Africans and Native Americans talks illustrates how the terms negro and black has been applied to people of American decent.  (28)[https://www.youtube.com/live/a3GaFbkRwYo?si=XBuVTNUSI6_Fys7o]</li>
    <li>&quot;It is apparent from the evidence that the term negro or its equivalent was not used for a race or a single stock of people or to point to ancestry or ethnicity. It was usually a simple
    description for perceived color.</li>
    <li>Negro or its functional equivalent mohr, moor, more (German Dutch French) in a very  broad sense.  The Portuguese also tended to use the term negro to encompass non Africans, people whose skin colow was a shade of brown... Negro or more almost  becomes equivalent to non-white or third-world in recent usage. </li>

In this illustration, a democracy ruled by the majority places the individual at the bottom, and an unknown elite, Mr. "X" at the top. The majority (or mob) elects a government to hire public "servants" who write laws primarily for the benefit of corporations. These corporations are either owned or controlled by Mr. X, a clique of the ultra-wealthy who seek to restore a two-class "feudal" society. They exercise their vast economic power so as to turn all of America into a "feudal zone". The rights of individuals occupy the lowest priority in this chain of command. Those rights often vanish over time, because democracies eventually self-destruct. The enforcement of laws within this scheme is the responsibility of administrative tribunals, who specialize in holding individuals to the letter of all rules and regulations of the corporate state, no matter how arbitrary and with little if any regard for fundamental human rights:

<tr><td colspan="2">
In the constitutional <a href="republic.htm">Republic</a>,...the rights of individuals are supreme. Individuals delegate their sovereignty to a written contract, called a <a href="../fz/consti.htm">constitution</a>, which empowers government to hire public servants to write laws primarily for the benefit of individuals. The corporations occupy the lowest priority in this chain of command, since their primary objectives are to maximize the enjoyment of individual rights, and to facilitate the fulfillment of individual responsibilities. The enforcement of laws within this scheme is the responsibility of sovereign individuals, who exercise their power in three arenas: the voting booth, <a href="../juryrite.htm">the trial jury, and the grand jury</a>. Without a jury verdict of "guilty", for example, no law can be enforced and no penalty exacted. The behavior of public servants is tightly restrained by contractual terms, as found in the written Constitution. Statutes and case law are created primarily to limit and define the scope and extent of public 
servant power.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2">
<font size="+1">Sovereign individuals are subject only to a common law, whose primary purposes are to protect and defend individual rights, and to prevent anyone, whether public official or private person, from violating the rights of other individuals. Within this scheme, Sovereigns are never subject to their own creations, and the constitutional contract is such a creation. To quote the Supreme Court, "No fiction can make a natural born subject." Milvaine vs Coxe's Lessee, 8 U.S. 598 (1808). That is to say, no fiction, be it a corporation, a statute law, or an administrative regulation, can mutate a natural born Sovereign into someone who is subject to his own creations. </font>
